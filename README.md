# Airbnb-Price-Predictor
ML model that predicts the price of Airbnbs based on their characteristics!

## Features
- Predicts price based on number of people accomodated, the number of bedrooms/bathrooms/amenities, the availability in the next 90 days, the location, the room type, and the minimum nights required
- Utilized Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis
- Employed techniques such as one-hot encoding, winsorization, normalization, and taking the log of features, for feature engineering
- Performed grid search cross-validation, model selection, model performance visualization, and feature importance analysis to optimize results
- Trained, tested, and evaluated the models Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) as part of model selection, ultimately selecting GBDT as the best model
